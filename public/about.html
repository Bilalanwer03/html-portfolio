<p>Hello everyone! Bilal here. A Insurance Sales Manager with over 6 years of experience in the Pakistan Insuance Industry turned to web developer by choice.
  I wanted to learn HTML, CSS and other programming languages to enhance my skill knowlege as in the technological era we are living we need to get pro 
  in programming as it will help us in multiple fields. Like if we want to do online business, digital marketing or even web development is it self a very
  interesting field.
</p>
<p>If I can help anyone in anything it would be my pleasure. As from helping I think I can learn more.</p>
<p>Cheers and Happy Programming! :)</p>
